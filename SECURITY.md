## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of vibe-code-bootstrap seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do Not** Open a Public Issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to avoid exploitation before a fix is available.

### 2. Report via GitHub Security Advisories

1. Go to the [Security tab](../../security)
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the security advisory form with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### 3. Alternative Reporting Methods

If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, you can:
- Email the maintainers directly (see CLAUDE.md or README.md for contact)
- Open a private discussion in the repository

### What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., injection, XXE, path traversal, secret exposure)
- **Affected files and locations** (file paths, line numbers)
- **Steps to reproduce** the vulnerability
- **Proof of concept** code (if applicable)
- **Impact assessment** (what can an attacker do?)
- **Suggested remediation** (optional)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 1-3 days
  - High: 1-2 weeks
  - Medium: 2-4 weeks
  - Low: Next planned release

### Disclosure Policy

- We follow **coordinated disclosure**
- Security fixes will be released before public disclosure
- We will credit reporters in security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We aim to publicly disclose vulnerabilities 30 days after a patch is released

## Security Best Practices for Users

When using vibe-code-bootstrap:

### 1. Protect Your Credentials

- **Never commit** API keys, tokens, or passwords
- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Review the `.gitignore` to ensure sensitive files are excluded
- Run `git status` before committing to check for sensitive files

### 2. Validate Agent Behavior

- Review agent outputs before executing suggested commands
- Understand what agents are doing, especially the `security` agent
- Use hooks to validate tool calls (see CLAUDE.md)

### 3. Review Generated Code

- Always review code generated by AI agents
- Test security-critical code thoroughly
- Use the `reviewer` agent for security-focused code reviews

### 4. Keep Dependencies Updated

- Monitor Dependabot alerts (if enabled)
- Review security advisories for Claude Code and MCP servers
- Update MCP servers and Claude Code regularly

### 5. Scope Agent Permissions

- Limit filesystem MCP access to project directories
- Review MCP server permissions in `mcp.tools.json`
- Use the principle of least privilege

## Known Security Considerations

### Agent-Generated Code

- AI agents can make mistakes
- Always review generated code for security issues
- The `security` agent provides validation but is not infallible
- Test thoroughly before deploying to production

### MCP Servers

- MCP servers run with your local permissions
- Review MCP server source code before installation
- Only install MCP servers from trusted sources
- Monitor MCP server network activity

### Template Files

- Templates are examples and may need hardening for production
- Review security settings before deploying templates
- Customize authentication and authorization for your use case

## Security Features

### Built-in Security

- **Security agent**: Pre-configured security review agent
- **Input validation**: Template code includes validation examples
- **Secret detection**: `.gitignore` configured to prevent secret commits
- **Code review gates**: Reviewer agent includes security checks

### Recommended GitHub Settings

Enable these features in your repository:

1. **Secret Scanning** (Settings → Security → Code security and analysis)
   - Enable "Secret scanning"
   - Enable "Push protection"

2. **Dependabot** (Settings → Security → Code security and analysis)
   - Enable "Dependabot alerts"
   - Enable "Dependabot security updates"

3. **Code Scanning** (Settings → Security → Code security and analysis)
   - Enable "CodeQL analysis" (if applicable)

4. **Branch Protection** (Settings → Branches)
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Require conversation resolution before merging
